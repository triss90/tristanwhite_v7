        <h2>The Challange</h2>
        <p>
          Rasmus Mikkelsen approached me expressing a need for a website. He was looking for a way to show and categorise his work.
          As well as an easy way for his clients to contact him. He had a crude idea about a color palette and a predesigned logo.

        <h2>The Solution</h2>
        <p>
          We decided to create a landingpage, allowing his visitors to quickly get an overview of his work and get in contact with him easily.
          We united his different social media to streamline his online pressence and lastly built a custom CMS for him to manage the content on his website.
